# Summer-Olympics-Performance-Analysis

In this exercise, I explored Summer Olympics data from 1896-2012, in order to understand the performance of leading countries over year. The objective is to find answers to the following questions:

* What are the top 10 countries in the history of Summer Olympics?
* How're their performances change over time?
* Which gender won more medals in summer Olympic? Did the pattern changed over time?
* What is the impact of socioeconomic variables on national performance in Summer Olympic games? (GDP, Population & per capita GDP)

I used some common R packages, such as ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, shiny and ggvis in data processing and visualizating. To answer the last question, I fitted a linear regression model to understand the relationship between medal count and GDP per capita & Population.
